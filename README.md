# Collaborative-Drone-Swarms-for-Payload-Lifting-using-Reinforcement-Learning

Abstractâ€”The concept of autonomous swarms continues to be
challenging as autonomous and collaborative behaviour modeling
becomes increasing complex. The advantage that reinforcement
learning (RL) provides is that an agent learns from the environment to provide optimal actions. In this work, we propose
an approach of implementing a drone swarm based on RL for
collaborative action specific to payload lifting and delivery.
